# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides a great developer experience with features like:

- **Server-side rendering**
- **Static site generation**
- **API routes**
- **File-based routing**
- **Built-in CSS support**

## Installation

To create a new Next.js app, run:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## File-based Routing

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.

\`\`\`jsx
// pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
\`\`\`

## Data Fetching

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: Static Generation and Server-side Rendering.

\`\`\`jsx
// Static Generation
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  
  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that makes building React applications easier and more efficient.

# Understanding Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and immutable record-keeping.

## How Blockchain Works

At its core, blockchain consists of:

1. **Blocks**: Collections of data
2. **Chain**: The blocks are linked using cryptography
3. **Consensus**: Network participants validate transactions
4. **Decentralization**: No single point of control

## Key Features

### Immutability

Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered without consensus.

### Transparency

All transactions are visible to network participants.

### Security

\`\`\`
Blockchain security features:
- Cryptographic hashing
- Distributed consensus
- Public and private keys
- No single point of failure
\`\`\`

## Applications Beyond Cryptocurrency

While blockchain is known for powering Bitcoin, its applications extend to:

- **Supply chain management**
- **Healthcare records**
- **Voting systems**
- **Smart contracts**
- **Digital identity**

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.

\`\`\`javascript
// Simple smart contract example (Solidity)
contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;
    
    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }
    
    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Challenges and Limitations

- **Scalability**: Many blockchains have limited transaction throughput
- **Energy consumption**: Proof of Work consensus is resource-intensive
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Legal frameworks are still evolving
- **Technical complexity**: High barrier to entry for development

## The Future of Blockchain

Emerging trends include:

- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Interoperability between blockchains
- Integration with IoT and AI
- Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)

## Conclusion

Blockchain technology has the potential to transform industries by enabling trust, transparency, and efficiency in digital transactions.

5. Source food locally

## Responsible Tourism Practices

### Supporting Local Communities

- Stay in locally-owned accommodations
- Eat at local restaurants
- Purchase souvenirs directly from artisans
- Respect cultural norms and traditions

### Protecting Natural Environments

- Stay on designated trails
- Follow "leave no trace" principles
- Avoid wildlife attractions that exploit animals
- Choose tour operators with strong environmental policies

## Packing for Sustainable Travel

Essential items include:

- Reusable water bottle
- Tote bag for shopping
- Reef-safe sunscreen
- Bamboo utensils
- Digital maps instead of paper

## Conclusion

Sustainable travel isn't about perfectionâ€”it's about making mindful choices that reduce your impact while still enjoying meaningful travel experiences.
